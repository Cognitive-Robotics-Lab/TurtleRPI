To launch the Kinect Tracker, and publish to /vo:
    roslaunch TurtleTracker TurtleTracker.launch

To launch the wiimote and publish to /imu_data
    rosrun wiimote kid_imu.py imu/data:=imu_data

The combined pose ekf is published to /robot_pose_ekf/odom

TO DO:
  - The robot pose ekf does not work when the wiimote is also running (check error messages)
  - The covariances for the TurtleTracker haven't been analyzed, maybe they should be changed
